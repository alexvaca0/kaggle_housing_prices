# kaggle_housing_prices

These scripts were used by another AFI student and me for the Kaggle competition regarding the prediction of housing prices. 
As the reader may observe, housing_cleaning.py is primarily a collection of variables and functions which we further use for our analysis and the development of the project. 
On the other hand, the file "housing_models.py" is used for trying and testing different models.
